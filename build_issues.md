# YeelightControl Build Issues Summary

## Main Issues

1. Ambiguous type references for Core_ prefixed types
2. Protocol conformance issues
3. Actor isolation issues with nonisolated protocol requirements
4. Missing type definitions
5. Duplicate type definitions across multiple files
6. Sendability issues with non-sendable types in actor-isolated contexts
7. UI component type mismatches with Core module types

## Progress Made

1. ✅ Removed duplicate `Core_Color` definitions from multiple files
2. ✅ Removed duplicate effect-related types (`Core_Effect`, `Core_EffectType`, `Core_EffectParameters`, `Core_EffectUpdate`)
3. ✅ Removed duplicate scene-related types
4. ✅ Created proper separation between device and Yeelight types
5. ✅ Fixed protocol conformance issues for several manager classes
6. ✅ Fixed `Core_ConfigurationError` usage in `ServiceContainer.swift`
7. ✅ Cleaned up `TypeDefinitions.swift` to remove duplicate type definitions
8. ✅ Fixed actor isolation issues in several manager classes
9. ✅ Fixed `Core_BaseService` protocol conformance in `UnifiedStorageManager`, `UnifiedAnalyticsManager`, and `UnifiedConfigurationManager`
10. ✅ Made `UserDefaults` and `FileManager` conform to `Sendable` to fix actor isolation issues
11. ✅ Fixed `UnifiedYeelightManager` to properly conform to `Core_YeelightManaging` and `Core_BaseService`
12. ✅ Added missing methods to `UnifiedYeelightManager` (`applyScene` and `stopEffect`)
13. ✅ Fixed UI components to use correct device types:
    - Updated `ScenePreview.swift` to use `YeelightDevice` instead of `UnifiedYeelightDevice`
    - Fixed `DeviceStateRow`, `MultiLightPreview`, and `StripEffectPreview` components
    - Updated `LightsView.swift` to properly handle `YeelightDevice` type
14. ✅ Fixed type alias for `YeelightDevice` in `UIEnvironment.swift`
15. ✅ Fixed background manager issues in `UnifiedBackgroundManager.swift`

## Remaining Issues

1. UI module issues:
   - Missing type references in some UI components
   - Duplicate view declarations across multiple files
   - Some environment object type mismatches
   - Invalid use of protocols as types without 'any' keyword

2. Theme environment issues:
   - Several components use @Environment(\.theme) which needs proper implementation
   - Need to create a proper theme environment key or use a different approach

## Recommended Approach

1. Fix remaining UI module issues:
   - Ensure proper imports of Core types in all UI components
   - Resolve duplicate view declarations
   - Verify all environment object types match Core module types
   - Add 'any' keyword where protocols are used as types

2. Fix theme environment issues:
   - Create proper theme environment key
   - Ensure consistent theme usage across UI components

## Specific Files Needing Attention

- Remaining UI module view files: Fix any type references and environment object declarations
- Theme-related files: Implement proper theme environment support
