    - Simplified string conversion logic to only check for the key being a string

## Remaining Issues

Based on the build output, we still have several issues to fix:

1. **Actor isolation issues**:
   - Several manager classes have async property access in functions that don't support concurrency
   - Need to properly implement nonisolated properties that access actor-isolated state

2. **Type conversion issues**:
   - Cannot convert between types like `Device` and `Core_Device`
   - Need to ensure proper type conversions or implement conformance to required protocols

3. **Storage method call issues**:
   - Incorrect method calls to storage manager methods
   - Need to update method calls to match the expected parameter names and types

4. **Protocol conformance issues**:
   - Some types don't conform to their required protocols
   - Need to implement all required methods with the correct signatures

5. **Missing members and properties**:
   - Some types are missing expected members or properties
   - Need to add the missing members or update the code to use the correct property names

## Updated Approach

1. **Fix actor isolation issues**:
   - Properly implement nonisolated properties that access actor-isolated state
   - Use Task and await properly in nonisolated contexts

2. **Fix type conversion issues**:
   - Ensure proper type conversions between Core types and implementation types
   - Implement conformance to required protocols

3. **Fix storage method call issues**:
   - Update method calls to match the expected parameter names and types
   - Ensure proper error handling for storage operations

4. **Fix protocol conformance issues**:
   - Implement all required methods with the correct signatures
   - Ensure all required properties are properly implemented

5. **Fix missing members and properties**:
   - Add missing members or properties to types
   - Update code to use the correct property names
