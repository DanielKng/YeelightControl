## Remaining Issues

Based on the build output, we still have several issues to fix:

1. **Device Type Issues**:
   - The `Device` struct is missing the `isConnected` property
   - The `DeviceType` enum is missing the `bulb` and `strip` members
   - The `DeviceColor` type has issues with the `red` property

2. **Storage Method Call Issues**:
   - The `storageManager.save` method is being called with incorrect argument labels (`key:value:` instead of `_:forKey:`)
   - The `storageManager.get` and `storageManager.getAll` methods are missing or have incorrect signatures

3. **Type Conversion Issues**:
   - Cannot convert between types like `Device` and `Core_Device`
   - Cannot convert between types like `Effect` and `Core_Effect`

4. **Protocol Conformance Issues**:
   - `UnifiedDeviceManager` does not conform to `Core_DeviceManaging`
   - `UnifiedEffectManager` does not conform to `Core_EffectManaging`
   - `UnifiedLogger` does not conform to `Core_LoggingService`

5. **Error Handling Issues**:
   - `Core_AppError` does not have a `sourceLocation` property
   - `Core_AppError.unknown` does not have associated values

## Updated Approach

1. **Fix Device Type Issues**:
   - Add the `isConnected` property to the `Device` struct
   - Add the missing members to the `DeviceType` enum
   - Fix the `DeviceColor` type issues

2. **Fix Storage Method Call Issues**:
   - Update all storage method calls to use the correct argument labels
   - Ensure the `storageManager` interface is consistent across all files

3. **Fix Type Conversion Issues**:
   - Implement proper type conversion between Core types and implementation types
   - Ensure all types properly conform to their Core counterparts

4. **Fix Protocol Conformance Issues**:
   - Implement all required methods and properties for each protocol
   - Ensure the method signatures match the protocol requirements

5. **Fix Error Handling Issues**:
   - Update the `Core_AppError` type to include the required properties
   - Fix the `unknown` case to properly handle associated values
